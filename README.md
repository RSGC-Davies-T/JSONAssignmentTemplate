Trip Planner:

Functions:
- [ ] Finds location of user in GPS coordinates :1
- [ ] Asks where you want to go and can recognize where that is :2
- [ ] Identifies station that is nearest to you :3
- [ ] *how to get there* :3.5
- [ ] Identifies which Direction you must go in :4
- [ ] Tells you when the next relevant train is coming :5
- [ ] TRANSFERS:6


Ideas:
1.
let locationManager = CLLocationManager()

// Ask for Authorisation from the User.
self.locationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization() 
// For use in foreground
self.locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
if CLLocationManager.locationServicesEnabled() {
locationManager.delegate = self
locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters
locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
}

func locationManager(manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
var locValue:CLLocationCoordinate2D = manager.location.coordinate
print("locations = \(locValue.latitude) \(locValue.longitude)")
}

2.
Currently my plan is to simply ask the user what station they want to go to, or they have the option at the start of the process to just simply check services at a specific station, or one near them. My plan is going to basically tie a JSON station feed with a variable, the system can check to see what station the user inputted, or maybe give a list of valid stations, and then lock that in as the desired destination. this way I can connect station names with data, and vice versa.

3.
luckily the TTC api provides an extremely handy coordinate related JSON that finds what vehicles are near you already. You simply must input into the html you latitude and longitude and it shows you the nearest vehicles. The tough part is getting the GPS coordinates into an html and I doubt its as simple as I am hoping.
4.
I will give every station on each line a number (I wince at the thought of all of that data entry), this way I can see if the desired station is east/west or north/east. If the desired station has a smaller number than the current then the app will direct you to the Kipling train for example. if the user needs to switch lines they will go by default to the nearest transfer station then it will decide where to go after that. For simplicity sake I am splitting line one into two different lines along union, just so I can make intelligent choices on where to transfer. I will invoke special protocol if the user wants to go to union station and what transfer station to take in that case.
5.
obviously the TTC JSON provides a lot of information, so I will only want to show the relevant train times, and I won’t show the times for the trains the user doesn’t want to take


The basic version of the app
For the sake getting something done I think I will start with something that I know I can do. I will take the users location, find the nearest vehicles, and list them out, telling the user when they’re leaving their respective stops

next I could add an option to choose the users location, or a specific station

then maybe I could add some basic trip planning

if the trip planning gets done ahead of schedule then I’ll try adding busses, but I don’t know to what end without making a full fledged apple maps copy.
